# Learning-graphql-with-dgs
This is an implementation of the sample photo application in [Learning GraphQL](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-graphql/9781492030706/). But unlike the book I use:

- [DGS Framework](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/) + Spring Boot for backend
- H2 for database

# Launch
- Execute Spring Boot
- GraphQL query playground is available on `http://localhost:8080/graphiql`
- H2 console is on `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
